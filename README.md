<h1 align="center">🐍 Snakebite Assist - MERN Stack Web Application</h1>



## 🌐 Introduction

<p align="justify">
Snakebite Assist is a comprehensive web-based system developed using the <strong>MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)</strong>. It is designed to help individuals quickly and efficiently identify snake species and access crucial information during snakebite emergencies.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Identifying the snake responsible for a bite is often a challenging task. Relying on visible symptoms or secondhand information from friends or relatives may lead to incorrect assumptions. Moreover, finding the nearest hospital and understanding the immediate steps to take—including first aid and medication—can be overwhelming.
</p>

<p align="justify">
<strong>Snakebite Assist</strong> addresses these critical issues by leveraging modern technologies like voice search, real-time hospital suggestions, and a user-driven blog system. The platform aims to be a lifesaving tool in emergencies and an educational platform for snake awareness.
